# RUMPUS ENGINE (formerly BREACH) — project guide for Claude Code

RUMPUS ENGINE is a **single-file browser game studio** — build worlds, play them (FPS,
racing, top-down, side-scroll), share them. Everything ships in one file, `breach.html`
(~30,000 lines). It uses three.js **r149** (UMD global: `const THREE = window.THREE`),
the Rapier physics engine, and PeerJS/WebRTC for multiplayer. There is **no build step** —
you open `breach.html` directly in a browser.

The author is Jarred Smith. The goal is a public release.

## Branding (build 952 rebrand)

The **visible name** is RUMPUS ENGINE; the **compatibility identifiers** deliberately keep
the old name — do NOT "clean these up":
- `breach.html` / `breach-help.html` filenames = live GitHub Pages URLs.
- `breach_*` localStorage keys = players' existing saves and settings.
- Share codes: new exports emit `RUMPUSLVL:` and download as `.rumpus`, but `BREACHLVL:`
  codes and `.breach` files must import forever, and the publish Action accepts both prefixes.
- Repo/community URLs still say `jarredksmith/breach` unless the repo itself is renamed
  (a user decision — it changes the Pages URL and would need a follow-up build).

## Repository layout

```
breach.html          # the entire game — the one source of truth
CLAUDE.md            # this file
server/              # self-hosted PHP backend pieces (deployed manually to the cPanel host)
  api/lobbies.php    # live lobby directory (build 956) — flat-file, no DB; see server/README.md
tests/               # Node test suite (unzipped from breach-tests.zip)
  run-all.mjs        # runs every test-*.mjs and prints "N/N harnesses passed"
  harness.mjs        # exports gameSource(), html, extractFunction, extractConst, assert, eq, near, done
  boot-harness.mjs   # support for the boot test
  test-*.mjs         # ~470 numbered tests
  package.json
```

The harness reads the game via `path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'breach.html')`, so
**`breach.html` must sit one directory above `tests/`** (i.e. at the repo root). Keep it there.

## The build workflow (follow this exactly)

Work in **one feature per build**. Each build is a tight loop:

1. **Re-grep / re-read the exact text before every edit.** Line numbers shift after each
   edit, so never trust a line number from a previous step — search for the literal code again.
2. Make the change.
3. **Syntax check**, then run the **boot test** (it actually executes the game source and
   catches runtime/TDZ errors), then the **full suite**:
   ```
   cd tests
   node test-202-boot.mjs          # executes the source — run after risky edits
   node run-all.mjs                # expect "N/N harnesses passed"
   ```
4. **Update any stale test pins.** Most builds that change a pinned code shape will break
   1–6 source-pin tests — this is expected. Update the regex to match the new code while
   preserving the assertion's intent.
5. **Add a numbered test** for the new feature. Prefer an *executable* test (extract the
   function with `extractFunction(...)`, run it via `new Function(...)` with stubs) over a
   source-pin where practical. Source-pins are fine for UI/wiring.
6. **Bump the build version** near the top of `breach.html`:
   `const BUILD_VERSION = 'build N · <date>';`
7. Commit (see Git below).

### Test conventions
- `.mjs` test files use JS regex literals with **single** backslashes.
- `harness.mjs` exports: `gameSource()` (the largest `<script>` — the game code, not the
  HTML markup), `html` (the full HTML incl. CSS — use for CSS/markup pins), `extractFunction`,
  `extractConst`, `assert`, `eq`, `near`, `done`.
- `extractFunction`'s brace-matcher breaks on functions that contain `{`/`}` **inside string
  literals** — pin those against the raw source instead.
- Some older test files don't import `eq`/`near`/`extractFunction`; add them to the import
  line if you use them.

### Recurring traps
- A `str_replace`/edit whose anchor is a function header must **re-include the header** in
  the replacement.
- After any edit, earlier views are stale — re-read before the next edit.
- When editing test-pin regexes that contain `|` or `\`, prefer a literal string `.replace()`
  in a small script over `sed` (sed escaping is error-prone here).

## Key engine APIs (orientation, not exhaustive)
- **Render pipeline:** `renderScene(scn, cam)` chooses post-FX (`_renderPostFX`) then DoF
  (`_runDofTo`); DoF composes *into* the post pipeline so focus blur survives effects.
- **Cinematics:** `cineCfg`, shots carry `path, lensFrom/To, focusOn, focusFrom/To, dur, look,
  interp, dofRange, dofStrength(+To), roll/rollTo, ease, holdStart/holdEnd`. Threaded through
  `_resShot / _normCineShot / _newCineShot / _newCutscene / _applyCine / serialize`.
  `updateCinematic` drives playback; `_cineEase(t, mode)` is the per-shot motion curve.
  Editor camera-preview window: `_renderCinePvWindow / _cinePvFrameAt / _renderPvDof`.
- **Pickups:** `pickupSpots {x,z,kind,item,y,rx,ry,rz,scale,interact}`, `buildPowerupMesh`,
  `updatePowerups`, `grantPowerup`, `_spawnFloorAt` (ceiling-aware spawn floor).
- **Inventory:** `invCatalog` (per-item def incl. its own `model` + `useType/useKey/useAmount/
  useConsume`), `inventory`, `defineItem/giveItem/takeItem/useItem`, `renderInventory/openInspect`,
  authoring in `renderInvItems`.
- **Multiplayer:** `NET {mode,myId,conns,phase,...}`, host/client message handlers, lobby
  keepalive (`startLobbyKeepalive`), co-op kill credit (`_coopKillFor`, `{t:'frag'}`).
- **Sharing:** `serializeLevel`, `.json` export/import (level + campaign), URL share links
  (`encodeLevel / buildShareLink`, decoded from `#lvl=` on load), challenge links.

## What only a human can verify
The Node harness can't see rendering or run a real session. A browser pass is still required
for: textures, AI scene builder, post-FX + motion blur, the DoF-with-effects path, cinematic
roll/ease/hold/DoF and the live camera-preview window, inventory panel + 3D inspector, pickup
transforms, interact-to-pickup, and real two-machine multiplayer. Asset licensing + a credits
screen are release blockers.

## Git
Initialize a repo and commit each build so you get a clean history (the build number is a
natural commit message, e.g. "build 619 — UGC cloud gallery"). Tag releases as they happen.

## The level generator (`tools/levelgen.mjs`) — orientation

One file, TWO homes: the Node CLI, and the browser (editor → Tools → **Generate arena…**), which
fetches this exact source and evaluates it in a worker behind `RUMPUS_LEVELGEN_HOST` (a Buffer
work-alike + fflate for deflate). Keep it dual-environment — never add a bare `node:` import.

- `node tools/levelgen.mjs <keep|spine|museum|castle|caldera> <out.glb>`
- `node tools/levelgen.mjs arena <out.glb> [seed] [theme|auto] [small|medium|large] [square|cross|octagon|diagonal|auto]`
  themes: industrial | castle | volcanic | garden | desert | frost | facility
- `node tools/levelgen.mjs tex <libid> <out.png>` — fast single-texture iteration
- Env knobs: `TEXSIZE` (texture res), `TEXAUX` (aux-map divisor), `NOTEX/NOMR/NONRM/NOLM` (bisection)

Conventions that are easy to break:
- **Nothing flush.** Decoration stands off structure by `PROUD` (5 cm) and rings are mitred. Two
  coplanar front-facing surfaces z-fight and flash as the camera moves. `test-1108` sweeps all seven
  themes for this and will catch it.
- **`nocollide*`** named nodes are decoration (grass): engine build 1093 skips them in every
  collider and neutralises their raycast; 1096 also stops them receiving shadows.
- **Interiors need `addLight`.** The bake integrates sky visibility + one sun bounce, so anything
  under a roof bakes black without a registered light. Light range is capped at the tracer's search
  distance (9.5) or the shadow test can't see occluders and light leaks through walls.
- **Author to the collider, not to the eye (build 1113).** The engine turns an imported model into a
  ~1-unit COLUMN grid and a column goes solid for its whole width as soon as a triangle touches it,
  so every surface stands up to a cell proud of where it was modelled — and a face lying exactly ON
  a cell boundary (round-numbered architecture does this constantly) costs the entire next cell.
  Measured: a 0.45-thick wall collides 2.0 thick. Hence `GRID_PAD` / `BOT_R` / `BOT_LANE` (3.8) in
  levelgen: **anything a bot must walk through is at least BOT_LANE wide**, doorways included.
- **Decoration waits its turn.** Wall-foot pieces are proposed via `later(...)` during the perimeter
  dressing and dropped after everything has reserved its ground; placing them immediately drops a
  boulder onto a gallery ramp. Mirrored cover tests BOTH copies against the reserved rects.
- **Probe before shipping geometry.** Ramps and stairs must read no pushes in the engine probe, not
  just look right. `tests/test-1113-stairs-bot-clearance.mjs` is the durable version of that probe:
  it builds geometry, runs breach.html's own `buildModelGridBoxes` over the triangles, replays the
  enemy obstacle resolution, and flood-fills to prove a bot reaches the roof. For ad-hoc work on a
  whole `.glb`, rebuild a scratchpad `probe-gen.mjs` the same way (parse the GLB, same two steps).

## Rendering: the colour pipeline (build 1115)

The frame is sRGB-encoded exactly once, at the end. Two things make that non-obvious:

- `renderer.outputEncoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding` only covers three's BUILT-IN materials. The post
  chain is raw `ShaderMaterial`s writing `gl_FragColor`, which `<encodings_fragment>` never touches,
  so the pass that writes the CANVAS applies the OETF itself via the shared `_OETF_GLSL` snippet and
  a `uEncode` uniform. Three passes can be last (DoF present, composite, afterimage copy) and each
  sets `uEncode` per frame. **Encode an intermediate target and the next pass blurs and grades
  gamma-encoded values** — that is the bug this design exists to prevent.
- `ColorManagement.legacyMode = false` linearises every hex colour on the way in, INCLUDING light
  colours. A saturated dark light colour loses most of its luminance (`0x4a6c7a` keeps ~34%), so
  intensities tuned before this change now read dim. Albedo moves the same way, and that is the
  stock level's real limiter: `floorColor 0x141c22` linearises to 0.0089.

Do NOT scale `lightMapIntensity` by PI. r149 already does it on upload
(`lightMapIntensity.value = material.lightMapIntensity * (physicallyCorrectLights !== true ? PI : 1)`).
An audit claimed otherwise from r13x-era reasoning; the double multiply blew the bake out 3.14x and
was caught only by capturing the frame and measuring it.

Levels carry `world.colorV`. Absent = authored before this build = rendered through `LEGACY_EXPOSURE`,
because correct rendering makes old content brighter than its author ever saw. `_worldFrom()` is the
only place that decides it — a legacy level must not inherit the default's `colorV:2` through an
`Object.assign`.

## Post-processing: the AO prepass (build 1126)

SSAO needs depth, and r149 **cannot** attach a depth texture to a multisampled target — which is
where build 872's 4× MSAA lives, the only antialiasing the engine has. Trading MSAA for FXAA was
tried and **measured**: on a pillar edge against the sky, MSAA gives a 1.02-pixel coverage gradient
on 100 of 100 scanlines; FXAA in its place left a hard edge on 94 of 99. So AO gets its own half-res
G-buffer prepass (`_aoGeoRT`, view normal in rgb + view distance in a) written with
`scene.overrideMaterial`, and MSAA stays. FXAA survives only on the DoF path, which was never
multisampled anyway. `tests/test-1126` and `scratchpad/edgeq.mjs` are the durable versions of that
measurement.

Three traps in that prepass, all of which shipped broken once:
- **"nothing drawn here" must be geometric, not a magic depth value.** The clear leaves the target's
  alpha near zero but *not* zero, so `a <= 1e-4` let every sky pixel through and AO shaded the whole
  upper half of the frame dark grey. A packed normal's channels sum to ≥ 0.63 for any unit vector and
  to ~0 when cleared — test that.
- `overrideMaterial` replaces `depthWrite:false` too, so the **sky dome fills the buffer** unless it
  is hidden for the pass. Weather points do the same.
- The prepass must run **after** the main scene pass or it consumes the frame's shadow-map refresh.

`_msaaOn`/`_msaaFails` are now `_hiFxOn`/`_hiFxFails`: build 883's ladder rung is unchanged, but it
carries MSAA *and* SSAO. `wipeScene` → `_postOffWorld` zeroes `ssao` along with the other post
settings — which silently disabled AO in every capture until `arenaMood` started emitting `ssao`.

## Headless capture

The engine renders under Chromium + SwiftShader, so visual changes can be measured, not argued about.
The whole game lives inside `window.GAME_START = function(){...}`, so page-level JS cannot reach its
internals: a harness has to drive the real UI. Capture at a FIXED generator seed or before/after
frames are different arenas and prove nothing.

**Know where the camera is before you judge the frame (build 1124).** Four rounds of visual
critique — "no sky", "contact shadows detached", "flat sunless lighting", "break the arena canopy
lid" — were all one bug: the player spawned at the origin, which is under the generated arena's
central mass, with 0.55 m of headroom. The rust "sky" was the underside of a rock. Nothing was
wrong with the sky, the shadows or the light. When a frame looks inexplicable, probe the scene
before theorising: a temporary `window.__probeUp` hook that raycasts up from `camera.position` and
stuffs the hit list into `document.title` costs one capture run and settles it, because
`page.title()` reaches out of the closure that `page.evaluate` cannot. Zeroing a suspect parameter
to its most extreme value is the other cheap discriminator — `normalBias = 0` producing NO acne
proved the geometry was never in the shadow map, which no amount of bias tuning would have shown.

## Open work (as of build 1124)

Roadmap: footprints + texture budget (done, 1110) → interiors (done, 1111) → multi-storey
(done, 1113) → more themes/materials (done, 1114) → emit gameplay data with the GLB (started,
1124: `info.spawns`).

**Shadow parameters are TEXEL quantities (build 1125).** `normalBias` is a world-space offset whose
correct size is a few texels of `2 * extent / mapSize`. Build 1095 tuned it to 0.6 against the fixed
±80 volume (7.7 texels); build 1120 made the volume `shadowDist` and the constant silently became
~20 texels — longer than the whole ground shadow a crate casts at noon. `_sunNormalBias(extent, px)`
is now the single derivation, used at boot and on every re-fit. `moon.shadow.bias` is a DEPTH bias
against an unchanged near/far and deliberately does NOT scale with it. If you touch the shadow
volume again, check what else was tuned against its old size.

**Gameplay data with the GLB.** Build 1124 added the first piece — `buildArena` returns
`spawns: [[x,z],[x,z]]` (BASE 1, BASE 2), the worker carries it back beside `world`, and *Place in
level* moves `playerSpawn` there facing the centre. The engine's forward is `(-sin yaw, -cos yaw)`,
so facing the origin from `(x,z)` is `atan2(x, z)` — `atan2(-x,-z)` looks the wrong way (there is
an instance of the wrong form in the maze generator, untouched). Next candidates, same channel:
enemy spawn markers at the arena's cover positions, the ramp centrelines (`scans`) as bot routes,
and pickup spots.

No known geometry bugs: both of the build-1112 repros (multi-storey stairs pushing enemies, the
cover crate clipping a ramp mouth) are fixed and covered by tests.

Themes are DATA (build 1114): a palette entry names its materials plus the treatments it wants —
`dress`, `joinery`, `plaza`, `yard`, `foliage`, `lightCol`, `depot`, `names` — and `buildArena`
contains no `theme === ...` branch. Adding the eighth theme is one `arenaPalette` entry, one
`arenaMood` entry, whatever new treatment names it introduces, and the editor's theme list.

Worth considering next, in the ENGINE rather than the generator: `buildModelGridBoxes` could emit
each column's box tight to the triangles that actually stamped it instead of spanning the whole
cell. That is the root cause behind `GRID_PAD`, and it would make every imported level's doorways
and corridors passable rather than only the ones this generator authors.

**Attempted and reverted (build 1123).** Recording it so the next attempt starts past the trap.
Tracking each column's real XZ footprint (a byte per edge, ~4 mm at a 1-unit cell) and emitting
boxes tight to it is easy, and both collider tests still pass. It does NOT fix a doorway. Measured
on a 0.2-thick wall with an ordinary 1.6 m opening: the collider gap stays zero, one box spanning
the whole wall.

Two reasons, in order:
1. The greedy merge groups columns by identical vertical runs, so a doorway's thin jamb columns
   carry the same full-height run as the wall either side, merge with it, and the union of the
   footprints spans the opening again. Adding the footprint to the merge key is necessary...
2. ...but not sufficient, and this is the real blocker: a footprint is per COLUMN while a column
   holds several RUNS. A doorway column contains the floor (occupying the whole cell) and the
   wall's jamb face (a sliver). Their union is the whole cell, so the key never distinguishes them.

The footprint therefore has to be per (column, run). Per-slot storage is 4 bytes x N x K, which is
fine for an arena (~750 KB) and 24 MB on the 331x148x366 skyscraper this feature exists to serve —
so it needs a budget and a fallback to per-column, in the style of MGRID_BITS. Do that first, then
the merge key, then the tight emit.

Also outstanding (user actions): upload `tools/levelgen.mjs` + `fflate.min.js` to the cPanel host
for the in-editor generator (see `server/README.md`), and re-upload the museum GLB.
